TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock base_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree

TIMING-30#1 Warning
Sub-optimal master source pin selection for generated clock

ULMTCS-2#1 Warning
Control Sets use limits require reduction  
This design uses 2887 control sets (vs. available limit of 13300, determined by 1 control set per CLB). This exceeds the control set use guideline of 15 percent. This is at a level where reduction is REQUIRED (see UG949). Use report_control_sets to get more details.

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ */SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '62' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
